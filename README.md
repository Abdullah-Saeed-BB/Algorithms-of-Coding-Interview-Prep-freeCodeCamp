This is all my implementation of algorithms using javascript.<br/>
All the algorithms is from [Coding Interview Prep](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/) at ***freeCodeCamp***

### What I learn?
- **Recursion** - Is the function that called it self somewhere in function, I used this technique in `noRepeatsPlease.js`, `implementQuickSort.js`, and `implementMergeSort.js`.
- **Time Complexity** - Is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to run as the input size increases, and now I know the different time complexity between all sort algorithms.<br/><br/>
